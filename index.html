			<p class="intro">If you’ve watched the local news or <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/04/ill-conceived-bail-reform-laws-have-plunged-new-york-into-a-state-of-chaos/">read a local paper</a>, you’ve probably heard that all crime is on the rise in NYC. 
            </p>
                
                <p class="intro"> But the data tells a different story. </p>

                <p class="intro"> From <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/historical-crime-data/seven-major-felony-offenses-2000-2021.pdf">2019 </a> to <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf"> 2022 (data year-to-date)</a>, the number of reported citywide murders so far this year remained relatively small, increasing from 319 to 393. Rape cases in that same time period actually decreased.
                </p>



<p class="intro">According to <a href="https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/christopher-herrmann">Christopher Herrmann</a>, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, violent felonies tend to be low in volume. Herrmann designates felonies into two categories: ‘expressive’, or violent crimes and ‘instrumental’ crimes, which tend to have a financial component attached. </p>

<p class="intro">Felony assault was an outlier in 2022. Herrmann attributes this to a continuation of a <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/alcohol-consumption-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-projected-to-cause-more-liver-disease-and-deaths#:~:text=Using%20data%20from%20a%20national,trends%20in%20all%20U.S.%20adults.">pandemic trend </a> of elevated alcohol use, which can <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa38.htm#:~:text=Alcohol%20may%20encourage%20aggression%20or,including%20inappropriate%20aggression%20(5).">increase aggression</a>. An increased trend of subway assaults <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-subway-assaults-jump-to-highest-level-since-1997-11643048166sharp"> </a> that began in 2021 also caused the number to spike. </p>


<p class="intro">“There are not many 'benefits' to violent crimes or expressive crimes,” Herrmann said. “Instrumental crimes, like carjackings, get you a car for a few days or weeks or years. Or maybe you sell the car for parts, or use it to commit another crime.” 
                    
                    <p class="intro"> G.L.A (Grand Larceny of a Vehicle) outstripped other types of instrumental crimes. NYPD saw a huge increase in incidents, from 5,430 in 2019 to 12,596 so far this year. </p>
                        
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    </p>
